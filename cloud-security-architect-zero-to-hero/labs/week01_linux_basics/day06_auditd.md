# Day 6: Linux Auditd Rules

## Why it matters
Detect suspicious file and privilege events.

## Prereqs
- None

## Steps
1. Configure auditd for `/etc`, `/var/log`, `sudoers`
2. Generate benign events and review

## Deliverables
- [ ] `/etc/audit/rules.d/custom.rules`

## Reflection
- What failed?
- How would you detect/prevent this in prod?
