# Day 4: Bash Scripting for IR

## Why it matters
Automate repetitive triage tasks.

## Prereqs
- None

## Steps
1. Write a script to capture: processes, open ports, recent logins
2. Save outputs to timestamped folder in `/var/triage`

## Deliverables
- [ ] `scripts/bash/ir_triage.sh` + sample output

## Reflection
- What failed?
- How would you detect/prevent this in prod?
