# Day 2: Processes & Networking

## Why it matters
Malware and intrusions manifest in processes and sockets.

## Prereqs
- None

## Steps
1. `ps aux`, `top`, `htop`
2. `ss -tulpn`, `lsof -i`
3. IPTables/NFTables basics
4. Create allowlist rules for SSH and HTTP

## Deliverables
- [ ] Firewall ruleset file (iptables/nft) committed

## Reflection
- What failed?
- How would you detect/prevent this in prod?
