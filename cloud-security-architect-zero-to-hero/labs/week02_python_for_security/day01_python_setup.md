# Day 1: Python Tooling Setup

## Why it matters
Foundation for building security tooling.

## Prereqs
- None

## Steps
1. Create venv, install requirements
2. Style with `black` & lint with `ruff`
3. Build `.env` pattern for API keys

## Deliverables
- [ ] `scripts/python/README.md` + venv screenshot

## Reflection
- What failed?
- How would you detect/prevent this in prod?
