# Day 2: Log Parsing & Regex

## Why it matters
Normalize noisy logs for detection.

## Prereqs
- None

## Steps
1. Parse SSH logs to detect brute force attempts
2. Extract IPs, users, timestamps; write CSV
3. Plot top offenders with pandas

## Deliverables
- [ ] `scripts/python/parse_ssh_bruteforce.py` + CSV

## Reflection
- What failed?
- How would you detect/prevent this in prod?
