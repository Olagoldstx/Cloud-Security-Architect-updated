# Day 6: From Logs to Detections

## Why it matters
Turn parsed signals into alerts.

## Prereqs
- None

## Steps
1. Define detection rules (YAML)
2. Convert to SIEM queries (KQL/SPL/Lucene)
3. Test with synthetic data

## Deliverables
- [ ] `labs/week06_siem_splunk_sentinel/detections/` YAML + queries

## Reflection
- What failed?
- How would you detect/prevent this in prod?
